### RAG vs. Fine-Tuning

### RAG vs. Fine-Tuning

RAG is often compared to fine-tuning, another popular method for customizing LLMs. 
- **Fine-tuning** adapts the internal parameters of an LLM on a specific dataset, teaching it new knowledge or a new style. It is computationally expensive and needs to be redone when the knowledge base changes.
- **RAG** is more flexible. It doesn't change the LLM itself. Instead, it provides the LLM with external knowledge at runtime. This makes it easier and cheaper to update the knowledge base; you simply update the documents in the vector database.

## Section 2: Architecture of This Application

This application is a production-ready RAG chatbot built with Python and FastAPI. It has a modular architecture that is designed to be scalable and configurable.

### Data Flow
---
To add new knowledge to the chatbot, you can add new text files to the `/data/default` directory. After adding the files, you need to rebuild the Docker container to run the ingestion script again:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

## Section 4: Customization and Extension

### Adding a New Domain

You can create a new domain for a different set of documents. 
1.  Create a new data folder, e.g., `/data/new_domain`.
2.  Create a new configuration file, e.g., `/configs/new_domain_domain.yaml`, and specify the new index name and data path.
3.  Run the ingestion script for the new domain: `docker-compose run --rm rag-chatbot-api python scripts/ingest_data.py --domain new_domain` (This assumes you modify the script to accept the domain argument again).
4.  In the chatbot UI or API, specify the new domain in your request.

## Section 1: Understanding RAG

### What is Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)?

Retrieval-Augmented Generation, or RAG, is an advanced technique for building chatbots and other natural language processing systems. It combines the strengths of two different AI models: a retriever and a generator.

1.  **The Retriever:** This model is responsible for finding relevant information from a large database of documents. When you ask a question, the retriever searches through the documents and "retrieves" the chunks of text that are most likely to contain the answer. In this application, the retriever is a vector database powered by Pinecone.

This application is a production-ready RAG chatbot built with Python and FastAPI. It has a modular architecture that is designed to be scalable and configurable.

### Data Flow

1.  **User Query:** A user sends a question through the UI or the API.
2.  **Embedding:** The user's query is converted into a vector embedding using a Sentence Transformer model.
3.  **Vector Search:** This query vector is sent to Pinecone, which performs a similarity search to find the most relevant text chunks from the indexed documents.
4.  **Prompt Augmentation:** The retrieved text chunks are combined with the original user query into a detailed prompt for the language model.
5.  **Generation:** The augmented prompt is sent to the generator LLM (Flan-T5-small), which generates a final answer.
6.  **Response:** The generated answer is sent back to the user.

### What is Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)?

Retrieval-Augmented Generation, or RAG, is an advanced technique for building chatbots and other natural language processing systems. It combines the strengths of two different AI models: a retriever and a generator.

1.  **The Retriever:** This model is responsible for finding relevant information from a large database of documents. When you ask a question, the retriever searches through the documents and "retrieves" the chunks of text that are most likely to contain the answer. In this application, the retriever is a vector database powered by Pinecone.
